# Notice

* You have to submit exactly one file (file name given in the problem statement).
* This file implements the procedures described in the task statement using signatures provided in the sample implementation.
* These procedures must behave as described in the task statement.
* You are free to implement other procedures.
* Your submissions must not interact in any way with standard input/output stream, nor with any other file. In particular, if your program outputs anything to standard output stream, its grading outcome on this test will be `SV` (Security Violation). You may output anything to standard error stream.
* Characters and some parts of the stories are based on the mythical part of [Shahnameh (the book of kings)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh), the world's longst single-author epic poem that is written more than 10 centuries ago by the Persian poet [Ferdowsi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi).

## Conventions
The task statements and the Implementation details sections use some generic type names  *boolean*, *integer*, *int64*, *string*, and *array*, .

In each of the supported programming languages the graders might use appropriate data types from that language, as listed below:

Language | boolean | integer | int64 | string | array | length of array `x`
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
C++ |  `bool` | `long` | `long long` | `std::string` | `std::vector<int>` | `x.size()`
Pascal | `boolean` | `longint` |  `int64` |  `string` | `array of longint` | `Length(x)`
Java | `boolean` | `int` | `long` | `String` | `int[]` | `x.length`
